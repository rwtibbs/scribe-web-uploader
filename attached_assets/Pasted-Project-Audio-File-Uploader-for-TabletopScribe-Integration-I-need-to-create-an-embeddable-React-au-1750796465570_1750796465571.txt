Project: Audio File Uploader for TabletopScribe Integration

I need to create an embeddable React audio uploader application that integrates with an existing AWS Amplify/AppSync backend. Here are the detailed requirements and technical specifications:

Core Functionality:

Authenticated audio file upload interface for tabletop gaming session recordings
Integration with Amazon Cognito for user authentication
File upload to AWS S3 with automatic Lambda function triggering for audio processing
Session creation and management through AWS AppSync GraphQL API
Campaign selection and session metadata input
Technical Stack:

React with TypeScript
Vite for build tooling
AWS Amplify v6 for authentication and file storage
AWS AppSync GraphQL API for data operations
Express.js backend for file upload handling
Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components for styling
AWS Configuration Details:

Cognito User Pool ID: us-east-2_p4Mv0gXrW
Region: us-east-2
S3 Bucket: scribe8a8fcf3f6cb14734bce4bd48352f80433dbd8-devsort
GraphQL API Endpoint: https://aye26gtfp5am3ogkvd3qb46xbm.appsync-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/graphql
Lambda API Endpoint: https://642l8cabx1.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dev/start-summary
Required Environment Variables:

VITE_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-2_p4Mv0gXrW
VITE_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=[provided separately]
VITE_AWS_REGION=us-east-2
VITE_S3_BUCKET=scribe8a8fcf3f6cb14734bce4bd48352f80433dbd8-devsort
VITE_APPSYNC_API_KEY=[provided separately]
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[provided separately]
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[provided separately]
Key Features to Implement:

Authentication Flow: Login screen with username/password using Cognito
Campaign Selection: Dropdown to select from user's campaigns via GraphQL API
Session Creation: Form to create new session with name, date, and duration
File Upload: Drag-and-drop or file picker for audio files (any size)
Progress Tracking: Upload progress bar and status indicators
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
Critical Implementation Details:

Use API key authentication for GraphQL requests (not user tokens)
File naming convention: campaign{campaignId}Session{sessionId}.{extension}
S3 upload path: public/audioUploads/
Lambda payload format: { sessionId, campaignId, audio_filename, user_specified_fields }
Reset form after successful upload to prevent duplicates
Server-side upload handling through Express.js middleware
UI/UX Requirements:

Dark theme with radial gradient background: rgba(1, 3, 45, 1) to rgba(1, 2, 19, 1)
Text color: #FCEBD5
Button hover color: #010213
Professional, game-focused aesthetic
Responsive design for desktop and mobile
Must be embeddable via iframe
GraphQL Schema Considerations:

Sessions have: id, name, date, duration, audioFile, transcriptionStatus, campaignSessionsId
Campaigns have: id, name, description, owner
Use proper versioning for DynamoDB updates (_version field)
Authentication Flow:

Check existing session on app load
Redirect to login if not authenticated
Fetch user's campaigns after authentication
Filter campaigns by current user's ownership
Upload Process:

Create session record in DynamoDB with "pending-upload" status
Upload file to S3 with proper naming convention
Trigger Lambda function for audio processing
Display success message and reset form
Please implement this as a complete, production-ready application with proper error handling, TypeScript types, and clean code architecture. Focus on reliability and user experience, ensuring the upload process works consistently with the existing AWS infrastructure.
