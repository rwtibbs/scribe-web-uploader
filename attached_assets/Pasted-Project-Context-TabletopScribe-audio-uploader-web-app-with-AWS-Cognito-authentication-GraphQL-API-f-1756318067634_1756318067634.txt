Project Context
TabletopScribe audio uploader web app with AWS Cognito authentication, GraphQL API for campaign data, and multi-environment deployment (development vs production).

The Problem
Mobile deployed environment only: On initial page load, users see "Having trouble loading campaigns" timeout message instead of their campaign list. After manual refresh, campaigns display correctly (4 campaigns including "Tomb of annihilation" with 45 sessions).

Environment Behavior
Development (Replit): Works perfectly on initial load and refresh
Deployed environment:
Initial load: Shows timeout message, debug shows Campaigns: 0 items
After refresh: Works correctly, debug shows Campaigns: 4 items
Technical Evidence
Authentication succeeds in both cases (user is logged in)
GraphQL API calls work (evidenced by successful refresh)
React state management functions correctly
Issue is specific to initial page load timing in deployed environment
Failed Approaches Tried
Loading state timeout modifications (8s → 12s)
React rendering condition simplification
Authentication state propagation timing fixes
Multiple useEffect hooks for state management
JSX syntax debugging and component lifecycle fixes
All approaches failed because they addressed symptoms, not the root cause.

Direction for Next Agent
Focus on deployment environment initialization sequence:

Authentication Context Timing: Compare how Cognito auth initializes between development and deployed environments on cold start vs warm start (refresh)

GraphQL Client Initialization: Investigate if the GraphQL client/API connection is fully ready before the campaigns query executes on initial deployed load

Session/Token Persistence: Check if authentication tokens are being properly restored from storage on initial page load in deployed environment

Network/Caching Differences: Examine if there are service worker, CDN, or browser caching differences affecting initial API calls in deployment

Key insight: This is a cold-start initialization race condition specific to the deployed environment, not a data loading or React rendering issue. The same code works perfectly on refresh because authentication context is already warm.
